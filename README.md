2. Values of the tables are created as models in the model package. These classes contain getter/setter methods and constructors.
3. Database queries are made in the dao package.
4. Servlets with functionalities such as logging in, logging out, and buying are created in the servlet package.
5. JSPs are used for the view, located in the WebContent folder. Additionally, some components are included in the includes folder using the Bootstrap 4.0 library.
